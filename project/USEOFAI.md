# Use of AI

## MySphere

We used the help of AI to create the MySphere model. The AI has helped us in the inplementation of the part of the code that generates the correct vertices with the specific angles needed
## MyForest

In the creation of the MyForest we used the help of the AI models to help us calculate and generate the correct code to make sure that the trees didn't collide upon change of the number or columns and rows

## MyBuilding

In this file we used the AI models to help us calculate the positions where the windows should be, in the function **drawWindows**


## MyScene

After the creation of the plane and making it bigger we used the AI to help us make the plane "infinite", helping us adding more planes with the camera move

## MyHeli
We used the AI to help us calculate the correct movement to the heliport automatically when L is pressed outside heliport and Lake.
Also we used to make the water falling animation.

Finally, we used it in general questions about errors that have occurred to us to identify more quickly what was happening.
